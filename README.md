 AI-Organized Comment Layer with Real-Time Video Context

 Overview
A revolutionary reimagining of YouTube's comment system that dynamically organizes and displays comments based on real-time video playback context. This intelligent comment layer enhances user engagement by making video discussions more contextual, discoverable, and mobile-friendly.

 Key Features

 Real-Time Video Synchronization
- Comments automatically reorganize based on current video timestamp
- Live floating comment overlay shows relevant discussions as they happen
- One-click navigation from comments back to specific video moments
- Dynamic time-window filtering (Â±30 seconds) for contextual relevance

AI-Powered Smart Organization
- Automatic comment clustering by topic and theme
- Intelligent sentiment analysis and categorization
- Topic-based filtering with native, non-intrusive UI
- Real-time relevance scoring based on video content and user behavior

Mobile-First Design
- Clean, readable interface optimized for small screens
- Touch-friendly interaction targets and gestures
- Horizontal scrolling topic filters to save vertical space
- Collapsible comment threads to manage screen real estate
- Fast loading and smooth animations

Enhanced User Experience
- Floating comments can be toggled on/off for distraction-free viewing
- Visual timestamp anchors for easy video navigation
- Expandable comment threads with reply previews
- Smooth transitions and contextual highlighting
- Maintains familiar YouTube interaction patterns

 Technical Implementation

Core Technologies
- React 18 with modern hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef)
- Tailwind CSS for responsive, utility-first styling
- Lucide React for consistent, scalable icons
- Real-time state management for video synchronization

Smart Features
- Time-based filtering algorithm for contextual comment discovery
- Topic clustering system using AI-generated categories
- Dynamic UI adaptation based on user interaction patterns
- Performance-optimized rendering for smooth mobile experience

Data Structure
```javascript
// Comment object with AI-enhanced metadata
{
  id: number,
  author: string,
  text: string,
  timestamp: number,        // Video timestamp in seconds
  topic: string,           // AI-detected topic
  sentiment: string,       // Positive/neutral/critical
  cluster: string,         // AI-generated cluster category
  likes: number,
  replies: number
}
```

 User Interface Components

Video Player Integration
- Mock video player with playback controls
- Progress bar with timestamp navigation
- Floating comment overlay (toggleable)
- Seamless integration with comment system

Smart Comment Sections
1. Contextual Comments - Relevant to current video time
2. Topic-Filtered Comments - Organized by AI-detected themes
3. Traditional Threading - Familiar reply/like interactions

Topic Clusters
